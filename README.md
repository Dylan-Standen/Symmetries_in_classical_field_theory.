# Symmetries in Classical Field Theory — A Brief Overview

> **Status:** Work in progress (paper + examples still being expanded)

This repository contains a **pedagogical review** introducing **classical relativistic field theory**, the **calculus of variations**, **Noether’s theorem**, and **continuous symmetries**, with worked examples including **real/complex scalar fields**, **Lorentz symmetries**, and **internal U(1)** transformations. The final section develops **Maxwell and Proca theory**, which is currently under construction. These notes are mainly aimed at people introducing themselves to QFT for the first time. They are mainly inspired by David Tong's lecture course as well as Matthew D. Schwartz’s excellent textbook on the subject.

## Outline (current draft)

1. **Introduction**
   - Aim, conventions, and context for the notes.
2. **What is a Field?**
   - Fields as smooth sections of fibre bundles (with an illustrative vector field figure).
   - Lagrangian density and action functional viewpoint.
3. **Noether’s Theorem**
   - Continuous symmetries → conserved currents/charges.
   - Energy-momentum tensor; brief discussion of Belinfante–Rosenfeld improvement.
   - Lorentz symmetry example: rotations → angular momentum charges; boosts → “centre of energy” evolution.
4. **Complex Scalar Fields**
   - Global **U(1)** symmetry and the associated conserved current.
   - Why local phase rotations break invariance for naive derivatives.
   - Introducing a **covariant derivative** and a gauge field to restore local invariance (motivational bridge to gauge theory).
5. **Maxwell and Proca theory**
   - **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** (planned expansion).

## Prerequisites

The notes are intended to be as friendly as possible, however, you’ll get the most out of them if you’re comfortable with some:
- Special relativity at the level of Lorentz transformations
- Multivariable calculus + index notation
- Basic variational calculus / Euler–Lagrange equations
